Today was a research day.  I spent time going into AWS.  It's not as clear cut as I originally thought, but I'm going to try to tackle it.  I'll be using the electricbeanstock and the s3 bucket for my storage needs.  Heroku has a nice little tutorial https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/paperclip-s3 and then so does Hackernoon https://hackernoon.com/how-to-setup-and-deploy-a-rails-5-app-on-aws-beanstalk-with-postgresql-redis-and-more-88a38355f1ea. The hard part was figuring out what permissions I have to give the app for it to work.
